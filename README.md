Doctor availability and specialization management. Hospital Management System

Project Description:

The Hospital Management System (HMS) project is designed to manage hospital operations such as doctor schedules, patient appointments, medical records, and more. It uses a relational database to track patient information, doctor details, appointments, and medical histories.

Database Setup:

Create a new database named "Hospital" to store the information.

Doctor Table: Stores doctor info (ID, name, specialization, contact).

Patient Table: Stores patient details (ID, name, age, contact).

Appointment Table: Stores appointment details (ID, patient ID, doctor ID, date/time).

Medical Records Table: Stores patient medical records (record ID, patient ID, diagnosis, treatment).

Tools using:

MYSQL
Queries and Analysis

The project includes various SQL queries and data analysis tasks to extract valuable insights from the hospital's data. Some of the key queries implemented include:

Join: Retrieve the names of all patients and their assigned doctors by joining the Patient and Doctor tables through the Appointment table.

Group By: Find the total number of appointments for each doctor, grouped by doctor name.

Order By: List all appointments in descending order of date and time.

Aggregate Function: Calculate the average age of patients in the hospital.

Join with Condition: Get all patients who have appointments with a specific doctor, joining the Appointment and Patient tables.

Case: Display the patient status as "Senior" if their age is above 60, otherwise "Adult", using a CASE statement.

Order By ASC: Retrieve all doctors sorted in ascending order of their specialization.

Group By with Having: List all doctors with more than 10 appointments, using the HAVING clause.

Join with Aggregate Function: Find the total number of medical records created for each patient by joining the MedicalRecords and Patient tables.

Aggregate Function with Condition: Count how many appointments took place in the last 30 days.

Join with Multiple Tables: Retrieve all appointments, patient names, and doctor names by joining Appointment, Patient, and Doctor tables.

Order By with Multiple Columns: List patients who have appointments sorted first by doctor specialization and then by appointment date in descending order.
